	abstract     = {[Knowledge is a broad and abstract notion that has defined epistemological debate in western philosophy since the classical Greek era. In the past few years, however, there has been a growing interest in treating knowledge as a significant organizational resource. Consistent with the interest in organizational knowledge and knowledge management (KM), IS researchers have begun promoting a class of information systems, referred to as knowledge management systems (KMS). The objective of KMS is to support creation, transfer, and application of knowledge in organizations. Knowledge and knowledge management are complex and multi-faceted concepts. Thus, effective development and implementation of KMS requires a foundation in several rich literatures. To be credible, KMS research and development should preserve and build upon the significant literature that exists in different but rzelated fields. This paper provides a review and interpretation of knowledge management literatures in different fields with an eye toward identifying the important areas for research. We present a detailed process view of organizational knowledge management with a focus on the potential role of information technology in this process. Drawing upon the literature review and analysis of knowledge management processes, we discuss several important research issues surrounding the knowledge management processes and the role of IT in support of these processes.]}

The labels for these fields can be confusing and overlapping, and what does and does not constitute an information profession has become unclear. We have available a body of theory and analysis that can form the basis of a review of this new professional landscape, and enable us to clarify and rationalize the array of emerging information professions. Work by the author and others on the philosophical nature, and core elements, of the information professions is drawn upon and applied to the current professional scene. The nature of information itself and of information-related activities are defined and closely analysed to produce models of the disciplines and the work elements within the disciplines of information. The analysis makes possible the incorporation of popular new information disciplines into an overarching framework that also includes pre-existing fields. The analysis provides a perspective that clarifies the relationships among the information disciplines as well as their relationship to other professional activities in society.},

Every disciplinary paradigm, however, contains elements that are less conscious and explicit in the thinking of its practitioners. The purpose of this article is to elucidate key elements of the below-the-water-line portion of the information science paradigm. Particular emphasis is given to information science’s role as a meta-science--conducting research and developing theory around the documentary products of other disciplines and activities. The mental activities of the professional practice of the field are seen to center around representation and organization of information rather than knowing information. It is argued that such representation engages fundamentally different talents and skills from those required in other professions and intellectual disciplines. Methodological approaches and values of information science are also considered.},

	abstract     = {During the 20th century there was a strong desire to develop an information science from librarianship, bibliography, and documentation and in 1968 the American Documentation Institute changed its name to the American Society for Information Science. By the beginning of the 21st century, however, departments of (library and) information science had turned instead towards the social sciences. These programs address a variety of important topics, but they have been less successful in providing a coherent explanation of the nature and scope of the field. Progress can be made towards a coherent, unified view of the roles of archives, libraries, museums, online information services, and related organizations if they are treated as information-providing services. However, such an approach seems significantly incomplete on ordinary understandings of the providing of information. Instead of asking what information science is or what we might wish it to become, we ask instead what kind of field it can be given our assumptions about it. We approach the question by examining some keywords: science, information, knowledge, and interdisciplinary. We conclude that if information science is concerned with what people know, then it is a form of cultural engagement, and at most, a science of the artificial.},

In fact, practices such as the encoding of data still lead to recording the results of the editorial work, consigning to oblivion the very essence of the latter, which, in our opinion, lies in the philologist’s knowledge and action. For this reason, we argue for a computational turn in philology, defining it as the use of performative code to model the processes at the basis of the creation of an edition (such as transcription, collation, stemmatological analysis, annotation etc.). It is our conviction that the introduction of programming in the realm of editing represents a major turning point in the history of philology, as it brings about a considerable increase in the accountability and reproducibility of the scholarly work, which are fundamental conditions for scientificity. To back up our arguments, we will propose two examples from our own work: the computational editions of the Early New High German version of Marco Polo’s travel account and of the Middle Dutch Of Reynaert the Fox. We will show the role and the advantages of computation in dealing with aspects such as normalisation and annotation of the texts, focusing in particular on the epistemological gains of our novel approach.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper starts by reviewing the relevant literature and then the results of an empirical study which investigated the perceptions of LIS community on the relevance of KM to libraries. The involvement of libraries in KM programs is also presented. Findings The results show that the LIS community exhibits a positive attitude towards introducing KM to libraries, and not only because this could bring libraries closer to their parent organization, but also because it might help them to survive in an increasingly challenging environment. Practical implications Although there are some indicators of involvement of libraries in KM in published case studies (through activities such as development of intranets and institutional repositories of content management and embedding information literacy instruction in the curriculum and employing web 2.0 technologies for knowledge sharing), libraries are still in the early stage of understanding the potential implications of KM. Originality/value The paper focuses on KM in the library community.}
